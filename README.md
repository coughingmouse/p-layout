# P Layout

Layouts that you don't really need to learn and doesn't suck as much as Qwerty.

## Introduction

#### 0.0
Learning keyboard layout always sucks. 

Learning Qwerty sucked. But you got away with it.
Learning Dvorak sucks because you have to relearn everything anyway.
TBH you only need to replace P (and T if you are an English user).
If you already learned Dvorak, it still sucks because you can't use copy--paste intuitively, nor play games without tweaking settings every time.

#### 0.1
If you think about it, the position of the special letters suck. Not intuitive nor useful.

#### 0.2
Ergonomics of normal keyboards suck. Home row assumes that your fingers are robot fingers. And pretty much every alternative keyboard layouts assume this "Home row" to be asdf jkl;.
All ergonomic keyboards suck as well, because you either have to relearn typing (e.g. Ergodox, planck) and is not any better tbh, or the keyswitches suck (e.g. Microsoft Ergonomic keyboards).

What if we could (at least partially) fix all this? With barely any effort?

## Usage
Put your fingers on [awef jto;] or [awef jtoi]. That is your home row. Boom.

## Design specifications
* Game/copy-paste compatible (preserves qwer/asdf/zxcv)
* Preserves modifier keys (Relearning these take a lot of time)
* Sane home row
* Work with any ISO compatible keyboard layout (European, US, KR types considered; but JP type to be considered optionally)
* Be as conservative as possible so that normal people may "actually" use it
